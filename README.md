## Project Overview
Our teamâ€™s project will be evaluating the potential success of NFL Rookies as it pertains to Fantasy Football. Frequently, rookies are highly hyped in fantasy drafts, and will usually either underperform (Marvin Harrison Jr in 2024 drafted as WR9, finished as WR34) or overperform (Alvin Kamara in 2017 drafted as RB58, finished as RB3). Our team is wondering: are there patterns in some of the data available that could help us have a more realistic assessment of rookie fantasy football value?

## Project Proposal
Our team aims to assess the potential performance of NFL Rookies for fantasy football. We will look at NFL draft data, first year performance data for previous NFL Rookies, combine performance, and career college stats for the Rookies.
